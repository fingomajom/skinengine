=============
For your information:

I build my iTreeSurf with 
	Windows2000Professional + sp2, 
	VC6.0 + sp5 + new "tlogstg.h" + new "exdisp.h".

Directories in VC options
	Include files: ( ! follow this order ! )
		C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\INCLUDE
		C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\MFC\INCLUDE
		C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\ATL\INCLUDE
		...[other directories if useful]

=============


 Following these steps to build iTreeSurf in VC6.0:

1) Copy "tlogstg.h" and "exdisp.h" to your VC include directory, 
	like "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Include".
	Please backup and then overwrite any old file.

2) Open iTreeSurf.dsw with VC6.0.

3) Now you can build projects and configurations for:

	iTreeSurf - Win32 Release - for static link version
	iTreeSurf - Win32 Dynamic Link Release - for dynamic link version
	TreeCN - Win32 Release - for Simplified Chinese language pack
	TreeENG - Win32 Release - for English language pack

4) You can get all of your release results in "iTreeSurfResult" directory.
	Final executables are in "iTreeSurfResult\iTreeSurf\".

ANY changes and/or patches are welcome!
